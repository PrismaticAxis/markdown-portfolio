These are a few of my favorite things: (as an aside, I just happened to have recently watched The Sound of Music for the first time since I was about five years old; just a fun fact)

- Fantasy (whether books, games, daydreams, whatever it may be; most of my interests end up revolving around fantasy to some degree)
- Music (in particular, two broad categories: electronic and what you might call "epic" music, the kind you tend to hear as soundtracks for movies, etc.)
- Books (Especially Brandon Sanderson novels, but any good fantasy story or book with an intriguing, unusual premise)
