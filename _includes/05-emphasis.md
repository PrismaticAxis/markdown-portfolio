(A quick preface: I _hate_ making bragging lists like these; it's easily the primary reason I've never been fond of resumes)

- I **enjoy learning,** to the point where that's one of the main things I do for fun: research random topics or have various educational videos on YouTube pulled up and/or playing in the background. I even have a link on my Bookmarks bar that opens a random Wikipedia article to use as a starting point for delving into a new topic.
- Directly related, I'm a **quick learner,** partially aided by the collection of random knowledge I've accumulated over the years, which create random connections that hint at deeper principles that aid in future understanding.
- I speak, read, and write **Spanish,** and I'm studying *German* and *Japanese* (though admittedly, progress with these latter two is currently rather slow).
